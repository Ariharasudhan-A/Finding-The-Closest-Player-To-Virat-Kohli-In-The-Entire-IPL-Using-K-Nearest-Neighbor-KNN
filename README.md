# Player Similarity Analysis Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze the similarity between cricket players based on their performance in IPL across different game phases. The project utilizes the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm with two distance metrics: **Euclidean Distance** and **Cosine Similarity**. The focus is on comparing various players with **V Kohli** to identify the most similar players.

The project involves:
- Stats extraction for every game phase from the ball by ball data for openers and one down batters in IPL
- Pre-processing the stats data
- Implementing KNN with Euclidean and Cosine distances for player comparison
- Visualizing the similarity between players using bar charts and heatmaps

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains ball by ball data of all IPL matches

## KNN Model and Similarity Metrics

The project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to find similar players based on the following distance metrics:

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- The code utilizes the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for identifying similar players based on their performance metrics.
- KNN computes distances based on both **Euclidean distance** and **Cosine similarity**.
- The nearest neighbors are determined using the metrics for the target player (i.e., Virat Kohli), and the most similar player is identified.

### 1. Euclidean Distance
- **Definition**: Measures the straight-line distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space, with each player's statistics as a point.
- **How It Works**: Calculates the absolute values of metrics, reflecting overall performance. Players with similar statistics score closely, regardless of specific performance traits.

### 2. Cosine Similarity
- **Definition**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, focusing on the orientation of performance metrics rather than magnitude.
- **How It Works**: Treats metrics as vectors, assessing similarity in scoring patterns rather than total runs.

### Implications of Differences
- A player may have similar overall statistics to Kohli (Euclidean) but differ in playing style (Cosine), leading to variations in similarity rankings:
    - **Euclidean** for overall performance similarity.
    - **Cosine** for style and scoring pattern similarity.

## Visualizations

The results of the analysis are visualized using:
- **Bar Charts**: Showing Euclidean and Cosine distances between players and **V Kohli**.
- **Heatmaps**: Visualizing the similarity across all players for both distance metrics, making it easy to identify closely related players.
